Communications from us may include telemarketing messages via email, landline phone, fax, cellular phone, text messages (including SMS and MMS), and notifications through any app that we may produce ("Communications"). We may use an automatic telephone dialing system which may use an artificial or pre-recorded voice or robotexts. Your carrier's standard rates and charges may apply. Agreeing to receive Communications is not a condition of purchasing any property, goods, or services from us.

                        Like most companies, we use tools from third party service providers to help us with some or all of our business through the Site(s) ("Service Providers"), and depending on the service we need, these Service Providers may have access to your Personal Information. For example, our third-party service vendors (such as mortgage lenders, insurance brokers, and title companies) may collect Personal Information from you, provided to them by you to help determine service eligibility. We also use Service Providers for the following purposes:

                        As we continue to develop our business, we may reorganize as a business entity, acquire entities, subsidiaries or business units, or enter into joint ventures with third parties. In any of these types of transactions, any information you provide may be one of the transferred business assets (subject to any pre-existing privacy notice unless you consent otherwise). In the event that all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, or we merge with a third-party, your information will likely be one of the transferred assets. You understand and agree that we reserve the right to transfer any information collected from you in the case of any such transfer. In such event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

                        We may disclose information you provide to respond to subpoenas, court orders, requests from authorities and other legal processes, and to establish/exercise our legal rights. We may also disclose your information to defend against legal claims when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We may share your information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
